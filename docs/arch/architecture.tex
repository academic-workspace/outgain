\section*{Overview}
Our system is comprised of three main components.

\subsubsection*{Client}
The client runs in each user's browser. It is responsible for rendering the game and collecting user interactions.
It communicates with the server over HTTP.

\subsubsection*{Server}
The server is the central part of the application. It accepts requests from clients and sends them updates.
It internally runs one engine per lobby, which simulates the interactions between players.
On every simulation tick, the server asks each AI to make a move, applies them, and detects collisions between entities.

\subsubsection*{AI Runner}
The server has to run untrusted user code, which has serious security implications.
As a protection, each AI runs in it's own ruby interpreter, in a seperate process, inside a seccomp based sandbox.
It communicates with the engine over a Unix socket pair.
The sandbox limits the system calls the process is allowed to make to the strictly necessary.
Any network or filesystem access is prohibited.
