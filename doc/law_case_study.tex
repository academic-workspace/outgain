\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Conflicts with freedom 0}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``you may only use the tools included in the Software to build the Singularity system, or build applications that will run on Singularity'' conflicts directly with the ability to run the tools as you wish, for any purpose.
    \item The license prohibits the user from running the code for the ``creation or use of commercial products or any other activity which purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or others''. Again, this conficts directly with freedom 0.
    \item Section 3: not being able to use any ``program... created through the use of the software... in the same manner as a comercially released product''. This conflicts with the the user's freedom to run for any purpose.
    \item Section 3: ``with data that has not been sufficiently backed up''. The fact that certain programs are not able to be ran using your own data if it is not backed up is definitely in disagreement with freedom 0.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conflicts with freedom 1}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item ``You may not use... any derivative works in any form for commercial purposes'' is in conflict with the freedom to ``change it so it does your computing as you wish'' in freeedom 1.
    \item Freedom 1 requires that the user may ``change it... as you wish'', however MSR-LA allows derivative works to be used ``solely for non-commercial academic purposes''.
    \item Section 2: The MSR-LA does not permit you to ``modify such portions of the Software'' which were ``in binary format'', this volates the freedom to ``change it... as you wish''
    \item Section 2: The user is not allowed to ``reverse engineer or decompile'' any ``software in binary format'', this does not grant the freedom to ``study how the program works'' or ``change it... as you wish''.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conflicts with 2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``You may not use or distribute this Software... in any form for commercial purposes''
  \item  ``You will distribute them under the same terms and conditions as in this license'' means that I may not be able to help my neighbour. (i.e if he/she needs to do something prohibited by the license)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conflicts with 3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  ``distribute the modified Software solely for non-commercial academic purposes''
  \item  ``You may not... distribute... any derivative works for commercial purposes''
\end{itemize}

It's also worth mentioning that section 9 can terminate the license entirely, violating all 4 freedoms.
